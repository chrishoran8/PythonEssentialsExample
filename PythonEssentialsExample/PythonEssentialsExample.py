#example python assessment

#q1) - create a variable called numOne and assign it with a float of 2

#2) Create another varaible called numTwo and assign it with a float of 5

#3) create a third variable called numSum which captures the sum of numOne and numTwo

#4) take an input from the user called numUser

#5)a create a variable called highNumber with the value assigned to 10

#5b perform a decision within the code which will output "High Number" 
#if the product of numUser and numSum is greater than highNumber
#and "Low Number" if smaller than 10 

#6) using a for loop create a list called firstList with the numbers 1-20 stored in it

#7) create a second list called secondList which stores the value of the corresponding 
#index in the first list multiplied by 2. e.g. [2,4,6,8....]


#8) create a third list called boolList which stores whether each element in secondList
#is higher than highNumber (True) or lower (False)



#Question 9 will be once we have completed Mod 41 and Mod 42 review Tuesday

#9a) create a func called numPrint that outputs a list of numbers between a starting 
#number and a finish number. The function should have two parameters startNumber and endNumber
#
#9b) once you have done 9a, make a change so that if the user doesnt input an end number 
#it automatically uses 10

#10)create a function which takes in a list of numbers as an argument. It then returns the number
#of odd numbers within the list. For example [3,4,5] should return 2

#11) create a tuple which stores the following values 3,4,6,5,3,5,7,8,5

#12) The values shown in question 10 refer to the number of goals scored by the following players 
#Rooney, Vardy, Heskey, Owen, Grielish, Sterling, Pele, Maradona, Walker
#Create a second tuple which stores these players

#13)) using the above tuples, link them via a dictionary.
#for example, Rooney:3, Vardy:4 etc. You should use your two tuples to construct the 
#dictionary
