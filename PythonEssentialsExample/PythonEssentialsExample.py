#example python assessment

#q1) - create a variable called numOne and assign it with a float of 2

#2) Create another varaible called numTwo and assign it with a float of 5

#3) create a third variable called numSum which captures the sum of numOne and numTwo

#4) take an input from the user called numUser

#5)a create a variable called highNumber with the value assigned to 10

#5b perform a decision within the code which will output "High Number" 
#if the product of numUser and numSum is greater than highNumber
#and "Low Number" if smaller than 10 

#6) create a list called firstList with the numbers 1-20 stored in it

#7) create a second list called secondList which stores the value of the corresponding 
#index in the first list multiplied by 2. e.g. [2,4,6,8....]


#8) create a third list called boolList which stores whether the each element in secondList
#is higher than highNumber (True) or lower (False)
